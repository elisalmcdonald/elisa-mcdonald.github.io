/**
 * 
 * OPERATORS:
 *
 * 0: Operators are special symbols that act on data. They're used to perform operations on values/variables like 
 * assign them to a variable, compare them, or used in arithmetic operations.
 * 
 * 1. Assignment Operators: Used to assign a value to a variable.
 *
 * 2. Arithmetic Operators: Used to perform arthmetic on numbers (litreals or variables).
 * 
 * 3. Comparison Operators: Used to compare two values to determine equality or difference and evaluate to true or false. 
 * Loosely equal to checks if just the value is equal and strictly equal to checks both if the value and data type are equal.
 * Unless there's a good reason not to use strictly equal to and strictly not equal to.
 * 
 * 4. Logical Operators: Used to compare two variables or values and determine the logic whether it's true or false.
 * 
 * 5. Unary Operators (!, typeOf, -):
 * 
 * 6. Ternary Operator (a ? b : c):
